NAME
    IPC::Run3::Simple - Simple utility module to make the easy to use
    IPC::Run3 even more easy to use.

VERSION
      This document describes v0.005 of IPC::Run3::Simple - released February 15, 2012 as part of IPC-Run3-Simple.

SYNOPSIS
     use IPC::Run3::Simple;

     # Dead simple, ignoring system error and getting rid of the final newline in
     # the output.

     IPC::Run3::Simple::chomp_out( 1 );
     my ( $out, $err ) = run3( [qw( ls -AGlh )] );
     die $err if $err;

     # Manipulate $out however you want.

     # Dump file listing into array, then chomp the array, ignoring any errors.

     IPC::Run3::Simple::chomp_out( 1 );
     my $args = {

      'cmd'    => [qw( ls -AGlh )],
      'stdout' => \my @files,

     };

     for my $file ( @files ) { print "filename: $file\n" }

METHODS
  chomp_err
      If a false value is passed, run3 will not chomp any error if it's stored in
      a scalar or array ref. Default is to chomp any error.

  chomp_out
      If a false value is passed, run3 will not chomp the result if it's stored in
      a scalar or array ref. Default is to chomp any result.

  croak_on_err
      If a false value is passed, run3 will return instead of croaking on error.
      Default is to croak on error.

  default_stdin
      Set the default stdin to be used.

  default_stdout
      Set the default stdout be used.

  default_stderr
      Set the default stderr to be used.

  run3
    This method is exported into the calling namespace.

    Expects either a reference to an array or a reference to a hash.

    If a reference to an array is passed in then it is assumed to be a list
    of the command and option(s) to be run. A list containing the results,
    errors and exit code (in that order) will be returned. See SYNOPSIS for
    an example.

    If a reference to a hash is passed in, the following information is
    expected:

     See IPC::Run3 documentation for possible values for each of these keys.

     'cmd'     Required
     'stdin'   Optional
     'stdout'  Optional
     'stderr'  Optional
     'options' Optional

    Note: If any of stdin, stdout or stderr are not passed in the hash
    'undef' will be used in their place.

    In addition, the following variables can be set, either in the hash
    passed in or globally via $IPC::Run3::Simple::VARIABLE.

     CROAK_ON_ERR If true, run3 will 'croak $stderr' instead of returning if $stderr
     contains anything.  Default is to return instead of croaking.

     CHOMP_OUT If true, run3 will 'chomp $$stdout' if stdout is a scalar reference
     or 'chomp @$stdout' if stdout is an array reference. Otherwise, it has no
     effect. If false, nothing will be done to the output of the call. Default is
     true.

     CHOMP_ERR If true, run3 will 'chomp $$stderr' if stderr is a scalar reference
     or 'chomp @$stderr' if stderr is an array reference. Otherwise, it has no
     effect. If false, nothing will be done to the error output of the call.
     Default is true.
